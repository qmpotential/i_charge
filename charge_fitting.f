C     THE VERSION 5.0 HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO FIT
C     PARTIAL ATOMIC CHARGES FOR MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
C     SIMULATIONS FOR A VERIETY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
C     A GRID OF ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL POINTS IS
C     GENERATED FROM QM CALCULATIONS AND THESE 
C     POINTS ARE FITTED TO AN ATOM-CENTERED POINT 
C     CHARGE MODEL. PARTIAL ATOMIC CHARGES ARE THEN
C     USED TO CALCULATE MOLECULAR MULTIPOLE MOMENTS.
C
C     ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL POINTS THAT LAY WITHIN
C     THE VAN DER WAALS ATOMIC SURFACES ARE EXCLUDED 
C     FROM THE FITTING TO AVOID CONTRIBUTION FROM 
C     EXCHANGE REPULSION AND CHARGE TRANSFER INTERACTIONS. 
C     
C     A SQUARE MATRIX A IS BUILT AND THEN IT IS 
C     DECOMPOSED USING LU (A = L U) OR SVD (A = U W V) 
C     DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUES. ONE OF THESE TWO TECHNIQUES
C     CAN BE CHOISEN BY PUTING .true. VALUE IN parameter.h FILE.  
C
C     CONSTRAINTS

C     Any constraints imposed should be based on
C     atom order number as it is listed in your 
C     cube file. The charge constrains should be 
C     imposed in a crossed closed way, see example below.
C
C     Example of an input file (charge.inp) for
C     dimethylcarbonate molecule.

C     CHARGE

C     0 should stand for if a charge is not equal to
C     any other charges by symmetry in the Constraint column.

C     0 should stand for if a charge is not fixed or 
C     predefined to any particular values in the Fix column.

C     1 should stand for if a charge is fixed or 
C     predefined to any particular values in the Fix column.

C     Predefined charges should be placed in the Charge column.
