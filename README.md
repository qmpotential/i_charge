C     THE VERSION 5.0 HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO FIT
C     PARTIAL ATOMIC CHARGES FOR MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
C     SIMULATIONS FOR A VERIETY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
C     A GRID OF ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL POINTS IS
C     GENERATED FROM QM CALCULATIONS AND THESE
C     POINTS ARE FITTED TO AN ATOM-CENTERED POINT
C     CHARGE MODEL. PARTIAL ATOMIC CHARGES ARE THEN
C     USED TO CALCULATE MOLECULAR MULTIPOLE MOMENTS.
C
C     ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL POINTS THAT LAY WITHIN
C     THE VAN DER WAALS ATOMIC SURFACES ARE EXCLUDED
C     FROM THE FITTING TO AVOID CONTRIBUTION FROM
C     EXCHANGE REPULSION AND CHARGE TRANSFER INTERACTIONS.
C
C     A SQUARE MATRIX A IS BUILT AND THEN IT IS
C     DECOMPOSED USING LU (A = L U) OR SVD (A = U W V)
C     DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUES. ONE OF THESE TWO TECHNIQUES
C     CAN BE CHOISEN BY PUTING .true. VALUE IN parameter.h FILE.
C
C     CONSTRAINTS

C     Any constraints imposed should be based on
C     atom order number as it is listed in your
C     cube file. The charge constrains should be
C     imposed in a crossed closed way, see example below.
