     THE VERSION 5.0 HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO FIT
     PARTIAL ATOMIC CHARGES FOR MOLECULAR DYNAMICS
     SIMULATIONS FOR A VERIETY OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.
     A GRID OF ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL POINTS IS
     GENERATED FROM QM CALCULATIONS AND THESE
     POINTS ARE FITTED TO AN ATOM-CENTERED POINT
     CHARGE MODEL. PARTIAL ATOMIC CHARGES ARE THEN
     USED TO CALCULATE MOLECULAR MULTIPOLE MOMENTS.

     ELECTROSTATIC POTENTIAL POINTS THAT LAY WITHIN
     THE VAN DER WAALS ATOMIC SURFACES ARE EXCLUDED
     FROM THE FITTING TO AVOID CONTRIBUTION FROM
     EXCHANGE REPULSION AND CHARGE TRANSFER INTERACTIONS.

     A SQUARE MATRIX A IS BUILT AND THEN IT IS
     DECOMPOSED USING LU (A = L U) OR SVD (A = U W V)
     DECOMPOSITION TECHNIQUES. ONE OF THESE TWO TECHNIQUES
     CAN BE CHOISEN BY PUTING .true. VALUE IN the parameter.h FILE.

     CONSTRAINTS

     Any constraints imposed should be based on
     atom order number as it is listed in your
     cube file. The charge constrains should be
     imposed in a crossed closed way, see example below.
